QuickHull
=========

An implementation of Quick Hull and Brute force algorithm for the convex hull problem.

Note - A lot of quickhull code is from the SushantKafle's implementation [link](https://github.com/SushantKafle/QuickHull2D) . Although his code has a lot of bugs which I came to know once I compared his results with my brute force hull results.
