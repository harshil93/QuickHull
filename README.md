QuickHull
=========

An implementation of Quick Hull and Brute force algorithm for the convex hull problem.

Note - A lot of quickhull code is from the SushantKafle's implementation [link](https://github.com/SushantKafle/QuickHull2D) . His code has some serious bugs which I came to know once I compared his implementation results with my brute force hull results.
